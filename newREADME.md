  ## Description:

  Above Me is a sleek educational tool that provides up-to-date details on a variety of satellites, asteroids and stars that are directly above the user. An overwhelming amount of information exists on-line regarding the universe outside of our planet. This app aims to deliver a daily, digestible amount of information to the user based on their location and what can be found above them. Based on the times of sunrise and sunset at the users location, the experience and  information that is accessible to the user changes. Upon sunrise, the user will find information on a satellite and asteroid that are currently near or in orbit  of the earth. After sunset, the user will be able to explore the sky above them by accessing an interactive map of the stars above and a photograph with corresponding information from NASA’s database below. Inspired by the “word of the day” concept, the goal of the ABOVE ME app is to provide updated information on a daily basis.

  For installation onto your device, this application can be cloned from the GitHub repository, using the "code" dropdown button, copy the "clone with SSH" text. Then navigate to the directory of your choice on your local machine and paste the text after “git clone”. After installation is complete open the file in VS Code.

  ## Usage:
  
  Upon visiting the page, the user will be prompted to share their location with the app. After sharing, the page welcomes the user and shares the concept of the page with them. The user's location is then used to dynamically populate the icon in the center of the page to one of two pages that are available. The sunrise page is linked between the hours of sunrise and sunset specific to the users location. The sunset page is linked after sunset until sunrise the following day.The user will then click the icon to begin their experience. The sunrise page presents the user with one satellite and one asteroid selection populated from information using the users longitude and latitude. When the satellite icon is clicked, the information is delivered in an expandable card containing relevant information and a map of the satellite's location. When the asteroid icon is clicked, the information in the card is populated about the asteroid and a link taking the user to a graph of the asteroid's trajectory. The sunset page presents the user with a single icon that, when clicked, populates the page with two windows.  The first window is a Sky-Map that is updated to the user's current view of the stars based on their right ascension and declination. This window is interactive and can be zoomed in and out and explored to get info about individual stars when moused over. The second window contains the NASA image of the day and accompanying description. The site is designed to be responsive to different devices and mobile ready as demonstrated in the following screenshots.
